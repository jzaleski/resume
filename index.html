        <li class="factoid">Rapidly grew the Transportation engineering team from 10 engineers to approaching 50 engineers within a year.</li>
        <li class="subfactoid">Coordinated onboarding for engineers both in Boston and our sister office in Berlin, Germany.</li>
        <li class="subfactoid">Partnered with business, operations and engineering leaders to develop plans about how to evolve the Transportation platform and team.</li>
        <li class="factoid">Focused on the rapid career growth of direct/in-direct reports.</li>
        <li class="subfactoid">Consistently held one-on-one&rsquo;s with all members of the team providing guidance both technically and non-technically about how to build their experience/skills.</li>
        <li class="subfactoid">Regularly involved in design/architectural meetings and the code review process.</li>
        <li class="factoid">Led and contributed to multiple process refinements.</li>
        <li class="subfactoid"><span class="underline">Onboarding:</span> Prior to my arrival this was 2 to 3 hours involving 1 or 2 senior engineers, due to our rapid growth this did not scale and in reality, due the complexity of our system was not sufficient. As a result we now have a comprehensive track with multiple topics including many business and technical deep-dives.</li>
        <li class="subfactoid"><span class="underline">Scrum of Scrums:</span> As the team grew in size, holding a mono-scrum was no longer possible. As we broke into independent scrums/teams we lost visibility into what other teams within the department working on. As a result the &quot;Scrum of Scrums&quot; was born. This meeting included both business stake-holders and engineering leads, allowing sharing, review and collaboration of/on current cross-functional/multi-discipline objectives.</li>
        <li class="subfactoid"><span class="underline">Weekly Engineering Update/Monthly Platform Meeting:</span> As the team grew in size, and more specifically specialized, it became difficult for engineers to have a pulse on what each team was working on. Knowledge sharing and Transparency are very important to me as a leader, so after hearing this feedback first-hand from a number of reports and reports of reports the Weekly Update (e-mail summary) and Monthly Platform Meeting (in-person update) were created.</li>
        <li class="subfactoid"><span class="underline">Ticket Grooming/Requirement Gathering:</span> Worked with business and engineering leaders on the &quot;Definition of Ready&quot; with regards to ticket grooming/requirement gathering. Suggested changes to the overall structure of tickets with a goal of making them more like user stories, including clearly blocked out acceptance criteria, testing criteria as well as go-live/deploy plans.</li>
        <li class="subfactoid"><span class="underline">Criticals Process:</span> My team&rsquo;s problem area was very data-centric and at times the system got out of sync. To combat this we had a Criticals Rotation. This concept pre-dates my arrival, but it became immediately apparent that it needed an overhaul. During my tenure we switched this from an e-mail list to a Kanban queue, got to the root-causes and made fixes to many of the underlying issues. I felt strong about having every Engineer on the team in the rotation as it provided a tremendous learning opportunity.</li>
        <li class="subfactoid"><span class="underline">Post-mortems/Retrospectives:</span> At Wayfair we moved fast, at times probably too fast. As a result of our speed, issues/bugs were a fairly regular occurence. On the surface level, this was fine but the learning opportunity that retrospectives and post-mortems provide was missed/not part of the process. In addition to leading a number of these types of meetings for my team(s), I worked closely with business and engineering leadership to establish guidelines on how and when these types of meetings made sense.</li>
        <li class="factoid">Involved with future planning/forecasting with regards to Architecture.</li>
        <li class="subfactoid">Identified and worked with engineering leadership to introduce the concept of a &quot;Transportation - Platform Team&quot; focused on scalability, monitoring, tools as well as platform/framework evolution.</li>
        <li class="subfactoid">Identified a need and short-coming of the current &quot;Remote&quot; development/testing environments and worked very closely with multiple infrastructure leads/engineers on defining/building a &quot;Local&quot; development solution/option. This solution is now used by approximately 50% of Wayfair Engineering and has been successfully proven as the platform of choice for all &quot;Wayfair Labs&quot; groups going forward.</li>
        <li class="subfactoid">Developed many re-usable components, in particular the <span class="italic">Transportation - Base Classes and Traits</span></li>
        <li class="factoid">Became the go to person for many technical topics.</li>
        <li class="subfactoid"><span class="underline">Isilon:</span> Became an expert/expert resource in the infrastructure and available tools/components by working with all teams involved (4) on refinements to the provisioning/migration process in order to meet an acceptable SLA.</li>
        <li class="subfactoid"><span class="underline">Logging:</span> Created a re-usable `Logging` component (a `trait`), now used by multiple teams across the company, aimed at simplifying and driving consistency around Kibana logging.</li>

        <li class="subfactoid">Worked closely with engineering and operations leadship to plan around how and when it made sense to split the engineering team in Berlin.</li>
        <li class="subfactoid">Worked closely with operations leadership to plan around when it made sense to split and/or refine the scope of US based teams (recurring).</li>
